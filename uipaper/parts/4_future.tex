\section{Conclusion \& Future Work}

We have presented the KAT system, an open, parametric, and browser-based annotation system for STEM documents encoded in HTML5. The code base is released under the Gnu Public License and is available at~\cite{KAT:github:on}. The system is in an early state of development, but can already be used for practical annotation and annotation review work\ednote{Nope, it has been changed}. The user interface both needs and is yet to undergo serious usability testing and polish, to both improve productivity and also to fully stabilize it for production use. The next steps will be to refine our annotation ontologies and integrate more linguistic ontologies to get more coverage.
