\section{Future Work \& Conclusion}

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \emph{Distinction between annotations.} - Currently we distinguish different annotation categories by color and give them a transparent opacity s.t. one can see if multiple annotations overlap. The color mapping is however not injective and it becomes difficult once there are more than two annotations overlapping.
	\end{enumerate}
