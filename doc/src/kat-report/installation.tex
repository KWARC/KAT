\section{Installation Guide}

In order to deploy \KAT, please follow the next steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\item In Makefile.in, change INSTALLDIR to the desired installation directory
  (e.g. /srv/http/kat or /var/www/kat).
\item Rename Makefile.in into Makefile. Run \textbf{make all \&\& make install}.
\item You will find a proof of concept demo at http://localhost/katInstallDir/test.
\item In order to add annotations, you need to add an annotation ontology first. You can
  do that in the \KAT Control Panel (link in the bottom-right of the page). For starting
  you can copy the example you find in test/annotations.xml.
\item The default storage environment is the browser's local storage. An API to connect to
  different storage environment can be found in the classes from the \textbf{remote/}
  directory.
\end{enumerate}
